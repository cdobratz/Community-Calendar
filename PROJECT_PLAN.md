# Organization Calendar Management System - Project Plan

## Project Overview
A GUI-based calendar management system for a residential organization with multiple houses, designed to manage events for 7 houses with 10 children each, plus staff events.

## System Requirements

### Organization Structure
- **Houses**: AV, SP, NL, LC, WH, HH, BP (7 total)

### Event Management
- **Event Types**: Meal, Campus Activity, Off Campus Activity, School Activity, Medical Appointment, Job
- **Categories**: Mandatory, Optional, House-specific
- **Scheduling**: Advanced planning with change capability
- **Recurring Events**: Support for repeating events
- **Time Slots**: Events require specific time scheduling

### User Access & Permissions

## Testing Strategy

### Test Data
- Create events for all 7 houses
- Mix of event types and categories
- Recurring and one-time events
- Edge cases (overlapping events, long titles)

### User Scenarios
1. **Community Manager**: Schedule all-community events
2. **House Parent**: Manage house-specific activities
3. **Staff Member**: Add medical appointments and job events
4. **Admin**: User management and system configuration

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **GUI Complexity**: Start with simple forms, enhance incrementally
- **Data Corruption**: Regular backup mechanisms, data validation
- **Performance**: Optimize database queries, limit date ranges

### User Adoption Risks
- **Training Requirements**: Create user manual and training videos
- **Resistance to Change**: Involve users in design process
- **Data Migration**: Plan transition from current system

## Success Metrics

### Functionality Metrics
- All 7 houses can manage their calendars independently
- Community-wide events display correctly across all views
- Recurring events work reliably
- Printing produces usable calendar outputs

### Usability Metrics
- Users can add an event in under 2 minutes
- Navigation between months is intuitive
- House filtering works without confusion
- Error messages are clear and helpful

## Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)

### Integration Possibilities
- Microsoft Outlook calendar sync
- Mobile app companion
- SMS/email notifications
- Tablet interface for common areas

### Advanced Features
- Child assignment tracking
- Staff scheduling integration
- Budget tracking for events
- Photo attachments for events
- Attendance tracking and reports

## Conclusion

This project will significantly improve the organization's ability to coordinate activities across multiple houses while maintaining oversight of community-wide events. The phased approach ensures a working system is available quickly while allowing for future enhancements based on user feedback and changing needs.
